🔗 Versioning & Traceability
Every artifact: commit hash, UTC timestamp
Audit logs: logs/incidents/

🛡️ Audit & Compliance – Ezra Orchestrator Workflow
The CI/CD pipeline follows 8 pillars, all enforced, traceable, and auditable:

1. Regulatory Compliance & Frameworks

SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001/27701, GDPR, LGPD, WCAG 2.1, HIPAA, PCI DSS
2. Code, Repository & Build Security

GPG signed commits, CODEOWNERS (2+ reviewers), git hooks, secrets scan, Vault/Doppler/AWS, OPA policies fail-closed, SAST Semgrep
3. Build Chain & Supply Chain Security

SBOM (CycloneDX/SPDX), Cosign, Sigstore/SLSA ≥3, in-toto, rootless BuildKit, ephemeral runners
4. Dynamic Audit, Scanning & Testing

DAST (ZAP), IaC scanning (tfsec, Checkov), container scanning (Trivy, Dockle), fuzzing, Kyverno/Gatekeeper, drift detection
5. Logging, Observability & Detection

JSON logs with hash+timestamp, W3C trace-id, OTLP metrics, SIEM (Splunk/Sentinel), eBPF (Falco)
6. Resilience, Monitoring & Recovery

SOAR, canary deploy + automated rollback, versioned post-mortems, versioned SLAs and RTOs
7. Code Quality & Performance

Test coverage ≥80%, Quality Gate, Lighthouse budget in CI, A11y scanner WCAG 2.1 in CI
8. Transparency, Evidence & Auditability

Compliance export (README, JSON, PDF), public audit table in README, artifact hash/timestamp, active tenant segregation, legally auditable logging
All requirements above are enforced, tracked, and documented in real time by the pipeline, ensuring compliance, traceability, and external audit/M&A readiness.

🏗️ DevSecOps Pipeline – Operational Model
Ezra Orchestrator is the central DevSecOps pipeline hub for the ecosystem, responsible for orchestrating, auditing, triggering, and consolidating all CI/CD, security, compliance, and traceability evidence for all products, microservices, tools, and integrations.
Each system/product may have its own local pipeline (for build, test, and deploy), but every critical event (commit, release, deploy, incident, compliance, audit, etc.) is reported, synchronized, and audited via Ezra Orchestrator.
The Orchestrator’s central pipeline guarantees governance, compliance, a single audit trail, centralized logs, evidence export, and global enforcement of policies.
Executive summary: local pipelines = operational agility and product/team ownership; central pipeline = governance, compliance, traceability, and readiness for external audit, M&A, and incident response.
Never distribute compliance – all audit trails and evidence must be centralized via Orchestrator.
🧠 Ezra Orchestrator Core Responsibilities
Custom GPTs and Private LLMs (e.g., GPT-6, GPT-4o, custom, open source, CrewAI)

All LLM queries, agent creation/management, RAG, embedding, and AI automation are routed and audited here.
Ezra Platform Core Products (Matrix products, ecosystem backbone)

See section below.
Ezra SaaS Products

100% of vertical products (BTMaritime, BTUrban, etc.) are executed, monitored, automated, and compliance-audited/orchestrated by Ezra Orchestrator.
Unified Dashboards

A single operational core centralizes monitoring dashboards, metrics, logs, audit trails, product status, and delivery flows.
Ezra Platform

Ezra Orchestrator is the technical backbone of Ezra Platform. All corporate layer, APIs, client integrations, audits, contracts, and request routing are handled here.
🧩 Universal Orchestration of Tools, Integrations & Infrastructure
Ezra Orchestrator centralizes, integrates, and audits any tool, workflow, repository, or pluggable service in the Ezra ecosystem, including:

Git repositories (versioning, automation, merge/pull/commit trace)
CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, ArgoCD, etc.)
SAST/DAST/Compliance (Semgrep, SonarCloud, ZAP, Trivy, Checkov, etc.)
SIEM, monitoring, logging, messaging, queueing, storage, data warehouse
External APIs, webhooks, automation agents, custom integrations
Any technical or operational stack (DevOps, DataOps, SecOps, FinOps)
All inputs/outputs are logged, audited, authenticated, versioned, and visible through centralized dashboards, ensuring full-stack governance and compliance for any connected tool.

🛠️ Centralized Maintenance of Systems, Products & Tools
Ezra Orchestrator is responsible for scheduling, executing, monitoring, and auditing all preventive, corrective, and evolutionary maintenance across the ecosystem:

Scheduling: maintenance windows, upgrades, patching, dependency updates, backup, restore, contingency/disaster recovery tests – all scheduled via Orchestrator panel or integrated API.
Execution: triggers, controls, and monitors maintenance jobs for all products, systems, microservices, and connected integrations.
Capable of running hooks, scripts, containers, pipelines, or declarative workflows, always traceable.
Audit: every maintenance job/process produces detailed logs, hash, timestamp, responsible person, and status (success/failure), available for compliance and export.
Communication: automatically notifies stakeholders of maintenance status, downtime, rollback, incidents, or operational recovery.
Rollback Control: automated rollback in case of failure, preconfigured in all maintenance playbooks.
Governance: all manual intervention (corrective/emergency maintenance) is registered, authenticated, and logged via Orchestrator.
All maintenance processes are versioned, hash-tracked, authenticated, with detailed logs and audit evidence, ensuring compliance, availability, and operational continuity across Ezra.
