📌 Branch and PR Protection ✅ Codebase 100% compatible — Implementation deferred by operational choice

All audit scripts, pipelines, and security tooling are fully compatible with strict branch protection rules (e.g., required reviews, status check enforcement, and up-to-date-with-main constraints). However, since development is currently handled directly by two developers only, we chose not to activate these rules, as real-time auditing is already enforced via the CI workflow YAML.

Protection can be enabled at any time with no changes needed in the codebase.
